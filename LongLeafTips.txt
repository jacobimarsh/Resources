Here are some Longleaf specific tips:

>>changing permissions:
In the project space everytime you create a new file/directory, only you have permissions to write and execute. To allow others in our group to access it, please use:

chmod -R g+rwX <directory-to-be-modified>/
chmod g+rwX <file-to-be-modified>/

This will provide only users in johrilab access to these files.  

>>start an interactive job in the terminal:
srun -t 5:00:00 -p interact -N 1 -n 1 --pty /bin/bash
